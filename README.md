# FinGuard AI: Your Personal Financial Companion

FinGuard AI is a cutting-edge financial management application designed to empower users with intelligent tools for retirement planning, investment analysis, and financial security. By leveraging advanced AI, including generative models for chat and data analysis, FinGuard AI provides a personalized, intuitive, and highly engaging platform to help users navigate the complexities of their financial journey.

## Key Features

### 1. Interactive AI Investment Advisor
At the core of the application is a sophisticated AI chatbot that acts as a personal investment advisor for superannuation and retirement planning. Users can ask complex financial questions in natural language and receive tailored, data-driven advice. This feature is powered by a Genkit flow that understands the user's complete financial profile to provide contextual recommendations.

### 2. Retirement Withdrawal Simulator
A unique tool integrated directly into the AI advisor allows users to simulate and compare different retirement withdrawal strategies. By asking questions like *"Compare a fixed vs. dynamic withdrawal strategy,"* users can receive on-the-fly, data-backed projections to help them make one of the most critical decisions for their retirement.

### 3. AI-Powered Financial Query Explainer
The dashboard features an AI-powered query tool that demystifies complex financial topics. Users can ask questions like *"How does inflation affect my savings?"* and receive detailed, personalized explanations that are easy to understand, effectively turning the app into a personal financial educator.

### 4. Transaction Anomaly Detection
To enhance security, FinGuard AI includes a fraud detection feature on the dashboard. It uses an AI flow to analyze selected transactions against the user's spending history and profile, flagging suspicious activity and providing a clear explanation for its assessment.

### 5. Comprehensive Financial Dashboard
The central dashboard provides a holistic view of the user's financial health, including:
- **Retirement Goal Tracking:** Visual progress towards their retirement goal.
- **Portfolio Diversity:** An interactive chart showing the current asset mix.
- **Asset Allocation:** A comparison of the user's current vs. recommended asset allocation.
- **Portfolio Risk Analysis:** An AI-powered assessment of the portfolio's risk level.

### 6. Risk Tolerance Assessment
Users can complete a guided questionnaire to understand their comfort with financial risk. The application uses an AI flow to analyze their answers and provide a clear risk profile (e.g., "Conservative," "Moderate," "Aggressive") and explains how that profile should shape their investment strategy.

### 7. Seamless Onboarding Experience
A smooth, multi-step onboarding flow introduces new users to the application's key features, ensuring they understand the value and functionality from their very first visit.

FinGuard AI is more than just a financial app; it's an intelligent partner designed to provide clarity, security, and motivation for your financial future.
